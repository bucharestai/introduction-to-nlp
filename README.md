Agenda

* Introduction to Colab, TensorFlow 	& Keras
* Introduction to word embeddings (Word2Vec)
* Pre-trained models
* Q&A

Notebooks

* [1.1 Introduction to TensorFlow](https://github.com/bucharestai/introduction-to-nlp/blob/master/1.1%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow.ipynb) notebook containing some basic usage of TensorFlow graph, as an example we implemented Logistic regression clasiffier as TF graph
* [1.2 Word Embeddings for IMDB](https://github.com/bucharestai/introduction-to-nlp/blob/master/1.2%20Word%20Embeddings%20for%20IMDB.ipynb) here create word embeddings based on IMDB dataset from Keras
* [1.3 Embeddings Visualization](https://github.com/bucharestai/introduction-to-nlp/blob/master/1.3%20Embeddings%20Visualization) here we have an example how we can visualize our embeddings in 2D or 3D using PCA or t-SNE
* [2.1 Pre-trained embeddings](https://github.com/bucharestai/introduction-to-nlp/blob/master/2.1.%20Pre-trained%20embeddings.ipynb) let's compare accuracy of our own word embeddings with one that can be found on the iternet, does it really help?
* [2.2 Sentence Embeddings] 
* [3. Clasiffier & TF Hub ](https://github.com/bucharestai/introduction-to-nlp/blob/master/3.%20Classifier_with_TF_Hub_and_Keras.ipynb) let's benefit from Google research team and reuse pre-trained model deliverd as ready-to-use modules on TF Hub
* [SGD](https://github.com/bucharestai/introduction-to-nlp/blob/master/SGD.ipynb) axuilarry notebook with explanation of SGD
